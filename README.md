# HACKOH-IO-Hackathon

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the AWS Challenge and decided to complete that challenge using the AWS Lambda function, EC2 Console Port, DynamoDB, and the Alexa System.

## What it Does
It takes user input if students are in need of assistance in certain classes then it provides resources for them through the Ohio State University.

## How We Build It
We built this project using the resources provided by AWS because part of the challenge was to implement a few of their frameworks/databases. The languages that were used were Python and Javascript, and the frameworks/databases AWS Lambda Function, EC2 Console Port, and DynamoDB.

## Challenges We Ran Into
We had several problems connecting our DynamoDB to our Lambda which affected the progress of our project in our Hackathon.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We are proud of the fact that we were able to finish our EC2 Console, our DynamoDB Table, code from our Lambda, and the Alexa System.

## What We Learned
We all learned a bunch of new things during this Hackathon such as using features from AWS which included a wide variety of them.

## What's Next
We plan to make our DynamoDB connect through our Lambda and implement a language interpreter in it. 

## Progress Log
### Day 1
12 PM: 
Initialized Lambda function.
Established EC2 Console Port.

3 PM:
Finished Alexa system. Established multi-intent interaction model, with a model accuracy of greater than 99% across 3 datasets, 5 trials per dataset. 

Our machine learning model tested as follows:

Natural Language Understanding evaluation: 
Percent Missed: 0.0038% 
Model Loss approximated at: 0.015%

Automatic Speech Recognition evaluation: 
Percent Missed: 12% trial 1, 0.002% average of all other trials. 
Model Loss aprroximated at: uncertain due to measurement error.

4 PM: 
Alexa system connected to Lambda function. 

6 PM:
Established the endpoints of the program.

9 PM:
Created the DynamoDB table for the project.

### Day 2
12 AM:
Tried to figure out how to connect DynamoDB through Lambda.

3 AM:
Fixed some of the Lamda Code that we had to debug.

6 AM:
Met with AWS mentor to try to fix parts of our project.

9 AM:
Made our video and pitch to submit our project.
