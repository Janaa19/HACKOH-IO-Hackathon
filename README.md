## Progress Log
### Day 1
12 PM: 
Initialized Lambda function.
Established EC2 Console Port.

3 PM:
Finished Alexa system. Established multi-intent interaction model, with a model accuracy of greater than 99% across 3 datasets, 5 trials per dataset. 

Our machine learning model tested as follows:

Natural Language Understanding evaluation: 
Percent Missed: 0.0038% 
Model Loss approximated at: 0.015%

Automatic Speech Recognition evaluation: 
Percent Missed: 12% trial 1, 0.002% average of all other trials. 
Model Loss aprroximated at: uncertain due to measurement error.

4 PM: 
Alexa system connected to Lambda function. 

6 PM:
